# Time Variant Distribution Viewer Component 

This project contains all work related to the Time Variant Distribution Viewer (TVD Viewer) component. The TVD Viewer is a React component that uses D3 to visualize time variant distributions and provides an interface to explore how aligned time varying distributions are with a prediction. 

I am working on making this component more customizable and reusable but for now I'm starting with a proof of concept based on some mock data with Moore's Law.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yp717/time-variant-distribution-explorer.git
cd time-variant-distribution-explorer
npm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
